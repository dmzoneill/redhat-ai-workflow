# Learn Tool Fix

Save a tool fix to memory so it's not repeated.

## Usage

After successfully fixing a tool, run this command to save the learning.

## What You'll Need

1. **Tool name** - The tool that was fixed (e.g., `bonfire_deploy`)
2. **Error pattern** - The error message that triggered the fix
3. **Root cause** - Why it failed
4. **Fix description** - What was changed

## Example

```
/learn-fix

Tool: bonfire_deploy
Error: manifest unknown
Cause: Short SHA doesn't exist in Quay
Fix: Use full 40-char SHA
```

## The Learning Loop

```
Tool fails → check_known_issues() → debug_tool() → fix → learn_tool_fix() → ✓
                    ↑                                            |
                    └────────── remembered for next time ←───────┘
```
