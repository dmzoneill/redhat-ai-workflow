# Universal Agent Configuration
# A combined toolset for most workflows, staying under 128 tools

name: universal
description: Combined developer and devops capabilities for full workflow support
persona: agents/developer.md  # Defaults to developer persona, can adopt others

# Tool modules to load (from mcp-servers/aa-*)
tools:
  - workflow      # 26 tools - Agent/skill/memory management (REQUIRED)
  - git           # 15 tools - Git operations
  - gitlab        # 35 tools - MRs, CI/CD, pipelines
  - jira          # 24 tools - Issue tracking
  - bonfire       # 21 tools - Ephemeral namespaces + deploys
  # - quay        # 8 tools - Image checks (use skopeo directly if needed)
  # - k8s         # 26 tools - Kubernetes (add if you need pod inspection)

# Total: 121 tools (under 128 limit)
# 
# Agent switching: Tools are fixed at startup, but persona changes via agent_load().
# When you say "load devops agent", Claude adopts the devops focus/expertise
# while keeping access to all the universal tools.

# This single agent supports:
# - Development: start_work, create_mr, review_pr
# - Ephemeral deployment: test_mr_ephemeral
# - Production debugging: investigate_alert, debug_prod

skills:
  - start_work
  - create_mr
  - review_pr
  - test_mr_ephemeral
  - investigate_alert
  - debug_prod
